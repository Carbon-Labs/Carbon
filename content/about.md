### What is CARBON?
**CARBON** is a utility token, rather than a security. **CARBON** will be used as the preferred payment method in
exchange of all products, services and tools being developed by Genesys Labs as well as a growing number of other
businesses.

**CARBON** is an open source ZRC-2 token. **CARBON** is also going to be the only accepted currency for an alternative model to the ICO model. Being developed by Genesys Labs, it will bring a new standard in fairness and transparency when it comes to financing on the blockchain.

Genesys Labs will be developing products and services for the benefit of all. These will all be powered by **CARBON**.


### Key Projects
We have 5 key projects that we will be developing over the coming months. These 5 projects are:

1. GRAPHITE
2. BOUNTY
3. CARBON PROOFS
4. AVATAR
5. TREASURY

Each of these projects will require **CARBON** to operate. We will release more details on each of these projects shortly, in
the meantime here is a small rundown on each of the projects.

#### GRAPHITE
A unique governance model that is fairer for the whole community. We will use this governance model to power Bounty.

##### BOUNTY
Bounty is a decision platform that lets you influence the direction a project should take. Making decisions based on demand. Bounty can accept CARB in the form of funding or alternatively via the governance model (where only a decision is desired as opposed to funding)

##### CARBON PROOFS
A "proof of existence" system built on top of Zilliqa and IPFS. This will allow anyone to prove that they had access to (and control of) any digital file at a certain point of time. We do this, by encrypting the file in question with a password that only the file owner knows. This file is then uploaded to IPFS and finally the IPFS hash is stored in the Zilliqa blockchain as an immutable record.

##### AVATAR
Avatar puts you back in control of your online identity! You should be able to access the internet freely without having to give up your personal information. Your unique blockchain address is the key to an internet that you want! Read more  [here](/projects/avatar)

##### TREASURY
The Treasury will be responsible for collecting payments for products and services we create. It is powered by a smart contract and also allows for the trading of CARB directly. It is based off our UTO model which you can read about [here](/projects/uto).
