# Graphite
> The CARBON Token Governance Platform.

_**DRAFT**_

## Summary
I first tweeted about this on twitter (https://twitter.com/MadMartian5/status/1305259778998808577) September 14th 2020. We are now going to implement this as part of our governance platform. Quadractic voting allows people to not just express what they like and don't like, but also how important it is to them.

If an issue is really important to you then you can choose to vote with more CARB to try and get the result you prefer.

At the end of the vote, all CARB is redistributed back to voters on a per capita basis (ie evenly distributed to all voters).

This would encourage more people to vote, knowing that they could potentially be rewarded for doing so.

## An example
99 people vote in favour of an issue with 1 CARB each. A whale wants to vote against the 99 people. Because of the way quadractic voting works, the whale will have to vote with 10k CARB. The whale gets what he wants and the funds are distributed. So 10099 CARB are distributed amongst 100 people. So each person receives aprox 101 CARB. A huge loss for the whale and a huge gain for the other voters.

Even though the whale got what they wanted, they had to distribute wealth to get it. And now, those passionate voters can put forward a new proposal and use their newly rewarded CARB to vote with. Using the same example but with the 99 voters voting with 101 CARB would mean that the whale is going to have to vote with 100million CARB (more than exists). This is how we get fair community governance. True representation of what the community wants.

## How is the cost of a vote calculated?
- 1 Vote costs 1 CARB
- 2 Votes costs 4 CARB
- 3 Votes costs 9 CARB

So the cost of a vote is the amount of votes you want multiplied by itself and paid in CARB

## Who can raise an issue, change etc on Graphite?
Anyone.. But. We don't want to flood it with every little thing, so there will be a cost to add an issue. The cost is included into the pool of funds that are distributed at the end of voting period. So, this guarantees that each voter will be rewarded for voting.
